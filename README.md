The Profitability Calculator is a complete app that helps sellers calculate Amazon fees and profits with real-time accuracy. It uses both a front-end interface and a powerful backend API to process data. Sellers input details like product category, price (with GST), weight, shipping type (Easy Ship/FBA), delivery speed (Standard/Express), product size, and delivery location (local or national). The app calculates total costs and potential profits instantly.
